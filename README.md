# LLMeshMine: LLM-Based Data Mesh Framework for Inter-process Behavioral Analytics

## Project Background
LLMeshMine is a framework designed to enable inter-process behavioral analytics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Data Mesh architectures. The project demonstrates how domain-based process analytics can be achieved through effective process-to-domain mapping, improving insights, resource allocation, and accuracy in complex environments such as healthcare systems.

## Use Cases
1. **Smart Healthcare**: Analyze and optimize workflows in organizations (e.g., hospitals).
2. **Behavioral Analytics**: Predict and improve user behaviors across interconnected systems.
3. **Data Governance**: Provide domain-specific insights using decentralized data management.
4. **Process Mining**: Facilitate inter-process analytics using data lakes transformed into data meshes.
